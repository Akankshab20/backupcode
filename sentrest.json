{"text":{"0":" Today, we put ourselves in the shoes of Cynthia Carro. Imagine you've become CEO of one of","1":" the world's largest mining companies, Anglo-American. $25 billion in sales, 162,000 employees, two","2":" thirds of them in South Africa, and four months into your job, you hear the news, one of the miners in","3":" Rustinburg has lost his life. Get another fatally. You have to decide are you going to shut down the","4":" mine or continue business as usual. David, if you can open for us today, your Cynthia Carro, the news","5":" comes to you. Do you shut down the mine in Rustinburg? Yes or no? What are you going to do?","6":" So I think she needs to initiate very detailed investigations into what happened in these","7":" circumstances and then what has happened throughout the past. Are you going to shut down or not","8":" shut down? So I'm going to do a detailed investigation. What are you learning? What are you learning?","9":" What are you learning in this investigation? Practices that are not being followed correctly or out","10":" of line or could be safer for there's like people are dying it's not safe. What evidence are you","11":" looking for? When you get the opportunity to participate you need to be able to","12":" compact the information that you're going to present in a very concise and clear manner.","13":" Through participation in class every day this is something that I am trying to sharpen.","14":" I want to get in on this. It's dynamic, it's fast-paced, there's a ton of energy. Everyone's","15":" really excited to jump in and contribute. I learn a lot from my peers as much as I learn from","16":" the faculty if not more. The professor kind of facilitates like a orchestra they kind of direct","17":" the music but they're not necessary playing it. I think we need to shut it down. Minor deaths","18":" are accepted as just a part of the process of mining. Shutting down the operation","19":" will signal a very strong mentality shift that deaths aren't going to be tolerated.","20":" That's called a bold stroke by the way. What Grant is talking about, what","21":" is OSAS talking about, Robert is talking about is a bold stroke which means from this day forward","22":" something has shifted but those of you who disagree say what? Those of you disagree say what will?","23":" I think we do much more if we improve the culture around safety and the entire organization.","24":" There's some truth that we're trying to work toward. The debates become more and more fun","25":" because that's when you get to uncover views that you hadn't thought of and when you get to","26":" push your own thinking and hopefully make your own thinking much much better. If you allow","27":" your perspective to be constructively challenged by other people then it is just fascinating how","28":" you know your position and your perspective can shift. Those of you who want to shut down how","29":" do you respond to this? Layla. We shut down the plant because we had safety issues and we made","30":" a stand and we started making a safety culture like we had a safety culture. The fact that we can have","31":" difficult uncomfortable conversations we can talk about race we can talk about politics and still","32":" be friends at the end of the day and to have people who are not from a specific group but still have","33":" sympathy and empathy is pretty unique. Beyond cultural and beyond structural we also talk about","34":" the people, the organization, the overseers are generally white and workers are generally black.","35":" The language within the community is called an agola and it's largely a command of control language.","36":" So you're saying some structural, you're saying some linguistic communication barriers,","37":" you're saying some organization cultural issues around the entire organization.","38":" I think the case of it that also gives you humility. Your perspective is not enough to figure out","39":" the answer to a question and actually gives you the ability to ask other people what their","40":" perspective is. So it's 27 countries represented in our section of 94 people and because of the way","41":" that the case method is structured we can sort of get underneath what are those differences really","42":" tied to. You know are there cultural things about where you come from that makes the business","43":" world operate slightly differently and are there things that we can learn from those differences?","44":" I think consumers are critical here so not only do they care about having high quality","45":" inputs to their supply chains on time but they will also care about safety in the first month or","46":" couple weeks of class I was hesitant to participate but over time I've gotten rid of all of my barriers","47":" and don't really have any qualms about participating but a lot of that is because of the support","48":" of my classmates and not only do I see it changing in myself but I see my classmates making","49":" better points over time which then also again pushes me to be better.","50":" They colder analysis is so so important when we think about change. So important to do. We think","51":" about who do we need to worry about and what do they care about what are their interests and so","52":" you start there but that's not enough. You have to then say where do I need to invest the most","53":" time? Who is in this zone? The board. I'm really worried about the managers. I think the government's","54":" also a key here because being in the case setting you realize how valuable everyone else around you","55":" is and how valuable their opinions are and the importance of being a really good active listener.","56":" So before we shift from this and think about some action planning I just want to show them","57":" hand because it's not clear to me in this room how many of you are shutting down?","58":" Really? And how many of you are not shutting down? So most of you are not shutting down.","59":" Wow. So are we going to resolve this now or are there points that we need to make?","60":" I don't know if I think this is a performance gap. I don't know if this is about best practices to","61":" me. This is about culture. If all these like if all these miners were like white and not black I think","62":" that death rates would look very very differently because I think people would consider the value of","63":" the lives of the people in the mind very differently. The question we have to ask is is this company","64":" extracting more value from the community than it's providing? It's scary to be vulnerable in a","65":" working world so you're oftentimes taught to put up a shield but here you're given an environment","66":" that supports you to take those risks and actually celebrates failures or celebrates diversity","67":" of thought when you don't agree with someone. Jumping into the arena using your brain to come to","68":" the best hypothesis and conclusion that you can given the data that you have is a task that","69":" leaders have to do every day. How do you use limited information to make a decision and do that","70":" in a way that forces you to flex that muscle of dealing with ambiguity. They don't get it Jake.","71":" Yeah, drag me a back up from the front lines to see your position. One of the things that I was","72":" thinking about is not just all of these different elements that we should be considering","73":" use of safety but also the leadership capability of Cynthia herself. You reliably took positions at","74":" your previous company. They were incredibly unpopular and encountered all sorts of resistance","75":" and I think this is a case where you shown that you could do it and so I would shut down.","76":" This situation is different don't you think? Is she suited for this job? Can she do this?","77":" I think that's an incredibly challenging question.","78":" That's what we do, Jake. This is what we do. This is what we do.","79":" We push students to take a position or to take a stand because it forces students to think deeply,","80":" to think about risks, to think about the weaknesses in their ideas and to also be open to","81":" influence. I want them to set high standards for themselves. I want them to be challenged.","82":" I want them to challenge others. So what initially brought me here was that I wanted to compliment","83":" these skills that I developed in architecture and consulting with business skills.","84":" But once I got here, those priorities completely changed. What inspires me now is really","85":" the having super engaged in discussions with my peers. I don't think that I've ever been that","86":" intellectually stimulated on a day-to-day basis because I am here and I think for me that's inspiring","87":" and it just wakes me up every day with excitement. I think I recognized that I wasn't pushing myself","88":" to think differently or to lead differently. I wasn't going to do anything extraordinary and I","89":" thought maybe if I came here, I would be pushed in a way that would lead me to develop into someone","90":" who could change something. At HBS, there's just no one here who wants to come out the same way","91":" they came in and that's really exciting. 30 years ago, Cynthia Carroll, 30 years ago,","92":" was actually in your seats and these exact same seats and because of her,","93":" thousands and thousands of miners in the world, I paid better, much safer, and are leading","94":" better lives with much more dignity. One day, not only that could be you, I know that one day it will be you."},"emotion_text2emotion":{"0":"Surprise","1":"Surprise","2":"Fear","3":"Fear","4":"Fear","5":"Angry","6":"Surprise","7":"Sad","8":"Surprise","9":"Surprise","10":"Fear","11":"Happy","12":"Sad","13":"Surprise","14":"Surprise","15":"Sad","16":"Happy","17":"Fear","18":"Angry","19":"Happy","20":"Fear","21":"Happy","22":"Surprise","23":"Fear","24":"Happy","25":"Surprise","26":"Sad","27":"Fear","28":"Angry","29":"Sad","30":"Fear","31":"Fear","32":"Happy","33":"Happy","34":"Fear","35":"Surprise","36":"Fear","37":"Fear","38":"Sad","39":"Fear","40":"Surprise","41":"Fear","42":"Surprise","43":"Surprise","44":"Fear","45":"Fear","46":"Surprise","47":"Sad","48":"Sad","49":"Surprise","50":"Happy","51":"Sad","52":"Surprise","53":"Sad","54":"Sad","55":"Surprise","56":"Fear","57":"Sad","58":"Angry","59":"Surprise","60":"Sad","61":"Fear","62":"Sad","63":"Surprise","64":"Sad","65":"Fear","66":"Sad","67":"Surprise","68":"Surprise","69":"Surprise","70":"Fear","71":"Surprise","72":"Surprise","73":"Fear","74":"Sad","75":"Angry","76":"Fear","77":"Fear","78":"Surprise","79":"Fear","80":"Happy","81":"Fear","82":"Sad","83":"Fear","84":"Happy","85":"Sad","86":"Happy","87":"Happy","88":"Happy","89":"Fear","90":"Surprise","91":"Sad","92":"Surprise","93":"Surprise","94":"Happy"},"('sentiment', 'cat')":{"0":["Neutral",0.0],"1":["Neutral",0.0],"2":["Neutral",0.0],"3":["negative",-0.1555555556],"4":["negative",-0.125],"5":["negative",-0.1555555556],"6":["Positive",0.52],"7":["negative",-0.2027777778],"8":["Positive",0.1222222222],"9":["Neutral",0.0],"10":["negative",-0.25],"11":["Positive",0.5],"12":["Positive",0.0766666667],"13":["Neutral",0.0],"14":["Neutral",0.0],"15":["Positive",0.2875],"16":["Positive",0.2625],"17":["negative",-0.0685185185],"18":["negative",-0.1555555556],"19":["Positive",0.5633333333],"20":["Positive",0.3333333333],"21":["Positive",0.3333333333],"22":["Neutral",0.0],"23":["Positive",0.25],"24":["Positive",0.4333333333],"25":["Neutral",0.0],"26":["Positive",0.5666666667],"27":["Positive",0.2875],"28":["negative",-0.1555555556],"29":["negative",-0.1555555556],"30":["Neutral",0.0],"31":["negative",-0.5],"32":["Neutral",0.0],"33":["Positive",0.2416666667],"34":["negative",-0.0833333333],"35":["Positive",0.2142857143],"36":["Positive",0.1],"37":["Positive",0.05],"38":["Neutral",0.0],"39":["negative",-0.0625],"40":["Neutral",0.0],"41":["Positive",0.2],"42":["Positive",0.1],"43":["Neutral",0.0],"44":["Positive",0.0533333333],"45":["Positive",0.25],"46":["Neutral",0.0],"47":["Positive",0.2],"48":["Neutral",0.0],"49":["Positive",0.5],"50":["Positive",0.4],"51":["Neutral",0.0],"52":["Positive",0.25],"53":["Positive",0.2],"54":["Neutral",0.0],"55":["Positive",0.2833333333],"56":["Positive",0.1],"57":["Positive",0.0981481481],"58":["Positive",0.1777777778],"59":["Positive",0.1],"60":["Positive",1.0],"61":["Positive",0.0416666667],"62":["Neutral",0.0],"63":["Neutral",0.0],"64":["negative",-0.1666666667],"65":["Neutral",0.0],"66":["Neutral",0.0],"67":["Neutral",0.0],"68":["Positive",1.0],"69":["negative",-0.0714285714],"70":["Neutral",0.0],"71":["negative",-0.05],"72":["Neutral",0.0],"73":["Neutral",0.0],"74":["Positive",0.3666666667],"75":["negative",-0.1555555556],"76":["Neutral",0.0],"77":["Positive",0.5],"78":["Neutral",0.0],"79":["Neutral",0.0],"80":["Neutral",0.0],"81":["Positive",0.16],"82":["Neutral",0.0],"83":["Positive",0.1],"84":["Positive",0.15],"85":["Positive",0.3333333333],"86":["Positive",0.4],"87":["Neutral",0.0],"88":["Positive",0.1111111111],"89":["Neutral",0.0],"90":["Positive",0.1],"91":["Positive",0.3],"92":["Positive",0.0833333333],"93":["Positive",0.35],"94":["Positive",0.3333333333]}}
